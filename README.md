##What is Binary Tree?

A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children.
A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), 
Thus, for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below. 
Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes it possible to distinguish a left child from a right child. 
But this still doesn't distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a one with right but no left child.
